What is git add vs git commit?
Git add stages files for commit. It tells Git which changes you want to include in your next commit. Git commit saves those staged changes to your local repository with a message describing what you changed.

Think of it like packing a box: git add puts items in the box, git commit seals the box and labels it. You can add multiple files before committing them all together.
