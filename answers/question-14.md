What does cat do?
The cat command displays the contents of a file in the terminal. CAT stands for "concatenate" but is commonly used to read files.

Example: cat file.txt shows the entire contents of file.txt on the screen.

You can also use cat to combine files (cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt) or create files (cat > newfile.txt, then type content and press Ctrl+D).
