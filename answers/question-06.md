What does pwd do?
PWD stands for "print working directory". It shows you the full path of the directory you are currently in. This is useful when navigating through the file system and you need to know your exact location.

For example, running pwd might show: /home/username/projects/myapp

This tells you exactly where you are in the folder structure.
