What are absolute vs relative paths?
An absolute path starts from the root directory and gives the complete location. Example: /home/user/documents/file.txt

A relative path starts from your current location. Example: documents/file.txt (if you're in /home/user) or ../file.txt (to go up one level).

Absolute paths always work regardless of where you are. Relative paths depend on your current working directory. Use pwd to see your current location.
