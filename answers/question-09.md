How do you create a directory?
You use the mkdir command (make directory) to create a new folder.

Examples:

mkdir myfolder - Creates a folder named "myfolder" in the current directory
mkdir -p path/to/nested/folder - Creates nested folders, including parent directories if they don't exist
The -p flag is useful when you need to create multiple levels of directories at once.
