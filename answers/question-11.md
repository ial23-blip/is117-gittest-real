How do you create an empty file?
The most common way is using the touch command. Example: touch myfile.txt

This creates an empty file named "myfile.txt" in the current directory. If the file already exists, touch updates its timestamp without changing the content.

You can also create files with other commands like: echo "" > file.txt or cat > file.txt (then press Ctrl+D).
