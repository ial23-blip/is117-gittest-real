What does git merge do?
Git merge combines changes from one branch into another. When you finish work on a feature branch, you merge it back into the main branch to incorporate your changes.

For example, if you worked on a feature in branch "feature-login", you would switch to main and run "git merge feature-login" to bring those changes into main. Git automatically combines the changes.
